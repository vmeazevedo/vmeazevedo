In the aerospace segment I worked on the development of algorithms for automating routines, calculations and functionality of electronic modules. I also participated in the development of the first idealized nano satellite, developed and produced by a Brazilian startup, entirely funded via crowdfunding.

In the automotive segment, I approved, tested and assisted in the development of several firmwares and applications developed by OnStar (Chevrolet) that impacted more than 150 thousand consumers in Brazil.

Currently I work at Itaú Unibanco in the Data Community, qualifying and distributing registration, negative and payment information, through solutions via Mainframe to assist in the decision making of the business and credit granting team.
